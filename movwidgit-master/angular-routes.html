Description: Changing views with routes and $location

Though AJAX apps are technically single-page apps ( in the sense that they only load an HTML on the first request,
and then jusst update areas within the DOM thereafters), we usually have multiple sub-page views that we show or hide fromt he user, as appropiate.

We can use Angular's $route service to manage this scenario for us. Routes let you specify that, for a given URL that the browser points to, Angular should loaf and display a template, and instantiate a 
controller to provide context for the template.

you Create routes in your application bby calling functions on $routeProvider service as a configuration block.  

**********************************************************
For the main Template, we'll do something  a bit different.
**********************************************************

Instead of putting everything in the first page loaded, we'll just create a layout template that we'll put our views into. WE'll place everything that persists from view to 
view,like our menus, here.
