<tr ng-repeat='message in messages'>
    <td>{{message.sender}}</td>

<!-- 
Notice here that we're going to let the user navigate to a particular message by clicking on the subject . 
We've data bound the URL to messageid, so clicking on a message with id=1 will take the user to /#/view/1.
We'll use this navigation-by-url, also known as deep-linking, in the message detail view's controller, to make a particular message available to the detail view. 

To create this message detail view we'll create a template that displays properties from a single message object.
