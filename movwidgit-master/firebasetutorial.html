Firebase can handle objects of arbitrary complexity. If it can be represented as JSON, it can fit in Firebase.

When objects are written to Firebase, the structure of the object is mapped to Firebase locations. In this example, when the object {name: name, text: text} is set, locations for name and text are automatically created as children of the location referenced by myDataRef.
