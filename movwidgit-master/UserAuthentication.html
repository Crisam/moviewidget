Adding an HTML Editing Tool

    This simple Weblog is quite adequate for many purposes. but it has one big disadvantage: You can't write up your dailt entries using the Web itself. Instead, you must create each entry 
    using a text editor like emacs or Notepad and save it to your Web server's docroot. This can be a significant issue over time, especially if you are not allowed telnet/ssh/FTP access to your server or
    aren't comfortable witht he process. HTTP is the next logical  step for many users.. and is probably no less unsafe than using FTP.
    
    
    This process has noe big problem: you need to give read /write persmission to the HTTP user ( usually Nobody ) in a particular directory. This is an inherently insecure process, and we do
    not recommend it in the long run. We'll describe the HTTP tools here so that you can become comfortable with the new aspects before moving on to a better solution, which is using a database instead
    of separate include() files for each entry. We'll also try to keep the secuiry problems to a minimum, emplying a password and letting you send mail to yourself if an unauthorized person tries to log in.
    
    
    The files you need for an HTML-based filed writing tool are:
    
        login.php
        logentry.php
        logentry_handler.php
        password.inc
        
    Put password.inc in a directory outside the Web tree, such as /home/htmluser. This will ensure that your passwords cannot be read via the web without being processed by PHP first. The directory must
    be world-executable and the document must be readable by the httpd user; if not, you may have to make the file world-readable, which is a security breach. Be sure to use a password different from your system user password,
    just in case it's comprimised.
